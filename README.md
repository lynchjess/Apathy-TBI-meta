Published as:

Lynch, J., Sarih, L.H., Mole, J., Revill, G., Bell, V. (2025) Prevalence and moderators of apathy after traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis. *Neuropsychological Rehabilitation*. [doi: 10.1080/09602011.2025.2559911](https://doi.org/10.1080/09602011.2025.2559911)

### Preregistration
This systematic review and meta-analysis was preregistered on PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42024552306. The pre-registration can be accessed [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024552306) and a copy is available in this archive.

### Archive contents
This archive contains the [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) code for the analysis reported in the above study. The code is presented as a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html) which are documents that combine both code and the output in a form that can be viewed online, but also re-run and the results reproduced when accompanied by the original dataset.

This repository contains a dataset with the extracted meta-analytic data and a Jupyter notebook that reports the analysis and results

1.  [Lynch_et_al_data.xlsx](https://github.com/lynchjess/Apathy-TBI-meta/raw/refs/heads/main/Lynch_et_al_data.xlsx) - datafile that contains extracted data
2.  [Lynch_et_al_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/lynchjess/Apathy-TBI-meta/blob/main/Lynch_et_al_analysis.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook that contains the reproducible analysis
3.  [Lynch_et_al_PROSPERO_Registration.pdf](https://github.com/lynchjess/Apathy-TBI-meta/blob/main/Lynch_et_al_PROSPERO_Registration.pdf) - copy of PROSPERO preregistration

### Platform and package versions

To aid reproducibility, the platform (hardware, operating system), R language version, and package versions used to generate the results are automatically generated at runtime and reported at the end of the Jupyter notebook.
